# Solar System

## Modeling
A program is required to model the concept of a solar system planet.

### A planet has the following attributes:
A name of type String with initial value of null.
Number of satellites of type int with initial value of zero.
Mass in kilograms of type double with initial value of zero.
Volume in cubic kilometers of type double with initial value zero.
Diameter in kilometers of type int with initial value zero.
Average distance to the Sun in millions of kilometers, of type int with initial value of zero.
Type of planet according to its size, of type enumerated with the following possible values: GAS, TERRESTRIAL and Dwarf.
Observable to the naked eye, of type boolean with initial value false.

### The class must include the following methods:
The class must have a constructor that initializes the values of its respective attributes.
Define a method that returns the values of the attributes of a planet.
Calculate the density of the planet, as the ratio of its mass to its volume.
Determine whether a planet in the solar system is considered an outer planet.
An outer planet is located beyond the asteroid belt. The asteroid belt lies between 2.1 and 3.4 AU. An astronomical unit (AU) is the distance between the Earth and the Sun = 149597870 km.
In the main method of the App class, two planets must be created and the values of their attributes must be displayed on the screen. In addition, the density of each planet and whether the planet is an outer planet of the solar system must be printed.

### Requirements:
The planet class must be tested. 
The Readme must show the class diagram.
